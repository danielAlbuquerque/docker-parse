A Docker image for the Parse Server with Dashboard pre-installed and a new feature to delete orphan files when a document associated with them is removed from the database.

It's based on [Express](https://expressjs.com) and supports single and multiple applications per instance.

## ü§ñ Usage

The Parse Server can be configured to support single or multiple applications per instance:

### Single application

Run the container using the image **vegidio/parse**:

```
$ docker run -d \
    -e SERVER_URL=http://server_host \
    -e MASTER_KEY=12345678 \
    -e DB_HOST=mongodb://database_host:27017 \
    -e DB_USERNAME=db_username \
    -e DB_PASSWORD=db_password \
    -e APP_IDS=app1,app2 \
    -e LIVE_QUERIES='app1:Movie,Actor|app2:Post' \
    -e DELETE_ORPHANS='app1:Review|app2:Comment' \
    -e DASHBOARD_USERNAME=dashboard_username \
    -e DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=dashboard_password \
    -p 80:80 \
    --name parse vegidio/parse
```

The full list of environment variables and how they can be used to configure your Parse Server can be found in the [Parameters](#-parameters) section.

### Multiple applications

If you want to run more than one application in the same instance then you just need to add them in the environment variable `APP_IDS`, in a single string separated by comma `,`.

For example, the environment variable `-e APP_ID=app1,app2,app3` will create 3 apps called `app1`, `app2` and `app3`.

### Live Query

To enable **Live Queries** you must specify during the initialization of your Parse Server exactly what applications and classes should have this feature enabled. To do that, add the environment variable `LIVE_QUERIES` with a content with this format:

```
<appId1>:<ClassA>,<ClassB>|<appId2>:<ClassC>,<ClassD>
```

where:

- `<appId>`: is the unique ID of your parse application, followed by the colon sign (`:`).
- `<Class>`: is the name of the class where Live Query should be enabled. If you want to enable Live Queries in more than one class then each class must be separated by a comma (`,`).
- Each application and its classes must be separated by a pipe sign (`|`).

For example, the environment variable `-e LIVE_QUERIES='app1:Movie,Actor|app2:Post'` will enable Live Queries in the classes `Movie` and `Actor` that belong to `app1`; and it will also enable Live Queries in the class `Post` that belong to `app2`.

### URLs

* __Apps:__ each app in the Parse Server can be accessed through the URL [hostname:1337/app/`app_id`]().
* __GraphQL:__ each app can also be accessed through GraphQL with the URL [hostname:1337/app/`app_id`/graphql]().
* __Dashboard:__ The Parse Dashboard can be accessed through the URL [hostname:1337/dashboard]().

## üß© Parameters

Here is the full list of parameters used by the Parse Server:

### Optional

If your database requires authentication then you need to set the parameters below when you run the Parse Server, otherwise they can be ignored:

- `DB_USERNAME`: the username used to login in the database. This user must have access to create new schemas.
- `DB_PASSWORD`: the password used to login in the database.
- `LIVE_QUERIES`: please see [Live Query](#live-query) above.

### Mandatory

- `DB_HOST`: the hostname and port where the database is hosted. You **must** include here the protocol `mongodb://` or `postgres://`, according to the database that you are using.
- `SERVER_URL`: the remote URL to access your Parse Server. You **must** include the protocol (`http://` or `https://`) here and the port, if needed.
- `MASTER_KEY`: the key used to grant access to the users that want to access the Parse API.
- `APP_IDS`: one ore more unique IDs, separated by comma `,` to identify your apps. These IDs will also be used to form the URLs of your Parse apps.
- `DASHBOARD_USERNAME`: the username used to login in the Parse Dashboard.
- `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`: the password used to login in the Parse Dashboard.
